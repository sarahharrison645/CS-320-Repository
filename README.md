How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
-Fore me, I feel the best way to ensure that my code, program, or software in functional would be to ensure that I am following industry best practices and testing frequently throughout the development process to avoid having to do big fixes later on and to ensure cohesiveness.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
-The best way to interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program is to clearly define the functional and nonfunctional requirements for a project and to create appropriate and through use cases for testing.

How do I approach designing software?
  I approach designing software with an "aim twice, shoot once" approach meaning that I place a heavy emphasis on the planning stage of the SDLC prior to even writing code. I have found that having a better foundation for my code means that I will run in to fewer issues of confusion later on.
